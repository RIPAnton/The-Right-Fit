<h1><strong>The Right Fit</strong></h1>

<p>Yes, I know. The name isn't the best.</p>
<p>The Right Fit is a student matching system developed for my senior project.
Its goal is to take student responses to a survey and match students into a compatible group for an assigned project.
</p>
<p>The system was developed in full-stack web fashion with the front-end consisting of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap, and the backend
consisting of PHP and MySQL.
