<p>This folder is where text files for each admin login are created as they add students to a survey.</p>
<p>Text files are created with a jQuery function so that the controller script can actually read in the student names upon submission of the form.
A secondary reason is for PHP to insert the names into the UI if the page is reloaded.</p>
